# v@r

The v@r email or volunteers@rethinkfoundation.in will serve as the bedrock of how we are looking to build our organisation. It serves as our communication, governance & transparency mechanism. This email will be the primary \(and even sole\) way one formally engages with the organisation.

Anybody who wishes to reach out to us for any guidance or sharing information are requested to make use of this email. All our volunteers receive a copy of the mail received on this email. You can then expect one or several of our volunteers to get back to you with the required guidance on the matter. Volunteers also ensure that volunteers@rethinkfoundation.in is marked in cc whenever guidance is offered by them on any matter.

In summary

1. Whenever someone looks to engage with Rethink, ensure that you are writing to volunteers@rethinkfoundation.in
2. Whenever you receive a response to your mail from one of us, ensure that volunteers@rethinkfoundation.in is marked in cc
