# Patrons

> Patron contributions are what we rely on to power our activities at Rethink.

**Patron contributions**

1. Financial contribution of 1000 INR per month
2. Time contribution of 1 hour a month to building out the organisation
3. Advocacy and referral to identify 1 additional patron

100 patrons contributing 1000 INR each will see us comfortably cover our initial cost of operations. . We hope to get to this point at the earliest, hopefully this month itself — [we are at 70 now](https://wiki.rethinkfoundation.in/Patrons).

> All our financials are transparent and public — accessible from our [Wiki](https://wiki.rethinkfoundation.in/Main_Page)

What we are looking to build is a patron driven model — people stepping up as a way of giving back and / or paying it forward.
