# Roundup update \#1

**Subject: Quick updates**

At the onset, thanks for agreeing to come onboard as a patron!

Few quick updates

\#1

We had got through the first round of N/Core program by Nudge Foundation. N/Core is an accelerator program for non profits. Next submission is on the 17th \(day after\)

Basically there was only 1 key question. The question and our response copied in this [Medium link](https://medium.com/@sijokuruvilla/n-core-application-b3699f919c5c) for easy reference

[About N/Core program](http://ncore.thenudge.org/)

[Full application that we submitted](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AHcPRFznCFxLt9DR8WD1LTDZqh298whmGLHFeY3rfWI/edit)

We have started with our weekly Live talk series. First of which happened on Saturday with Praveen Sridhar \([Link to Praveen’s profile on our Wiki](http://wiki.rethinkfoundation.in/Praveen_Sridhar)\). He was the winner of the IBM Openpower developer challenge and in his Live he talks about his program experience. You can watch the video [here](https://www.facebook.com/rethinkcollective/videos/vb.695796320574660/912701392217484/?type=2&theater&notif_t=like&notif_id=1502723224019061). Going forward, we will look to have a Live talk every Saturday at 11am. This is structured as an exposure piece. For deeper engagement, we will be looking at having an AMA layer on our Reddit

\#3

Our wiki is slowly getting into shape — [http://wiki.rethinkfoundation.in/Main\_Page](http://wiki.rethinkfoundation.in/Main_Page).

Primarily, we have page each for opportunities, people & projects

Arya is eagerly working away on this, with ample support being extended by Aby

\#4

Our [Reddit board](https://www.reddit.com/r/RethinkCommunity/) is also showing early signs of activity. This serves as a repository of all information discovered by our community

\#5

Started working on our website too. Its a work in progress and what we have now is very rudimentary

The patron page will be up in a couple of days — waiting to have all pics mailed in

\#6

Zach has quickly put together a very simple and nice app for us. You can get it from the Platstore should you wish to check it out — Ask [Rethink](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rethink.ama&hl=en). PS: Do take a look at the app description and let me know what you think ;\)

\#7

Our bank account opening took inordinate time. Finally, we have that resolved and also got our UPI configured -rethink@icici. Yet to reflect on BHIM app — once that has been resolved, we will look to configure rethink@upi

\#8

Looking to get to 100 patrons this month. At about 50 now and my priority focus will be on this itself this month.

\#9

We had picked up a small space on seaport airport road — to serve as a workspace for us and for our volunteers.

Do make sure you drop by when you are in this side of town next

\#10

Arya joined in about a two months back. Yadu is expected to join in a week
