Dear Startup Village well wishers,

A personal request on Entrepreneurship Day!

I believe you would have known about the Government’s decision to allocate 1% of the Government budget towards supporting youth entrepreneurship. The CM made this information public during his Hangout speech today. This has been influenced by the entrepreneurial momentum that was visible on the ground over the last one year and more particularly on the 28th of July at Startup Village. The Government has also come out with a revised Government Order simplifying the process by which our students can avail the attendance and grace marks as per the Student Entrepreneurship policy. Details are available on the CM’s website: [http://www.keralacm.gov.in/sep/](http://www.keralacm.gov.in/sep/)

I request you to all to spread the message to people in your fellow community as well by sharing the campaign video on your FB wall. The link to the post that contains our video is provided below. It would be great if you could also add your message or thoughts as well when you share the video. Do remind to include the hashtag \#startupday

Your shares will go a long way in ensuring that we provide sufficient feedback and support to the Government in their decision to support the startup journey of the youth of Kerala.

Regards, Sijo
