# The template

**Note**: The note was originally published on August 29, 2011

The way of the world is a simple plan; a template that when followed will yield good dividends for those who can’t or don’t want to think. A simple plan which gives life a purpose and a sense of achievement by means of mutually agreed upon societal approval.

The simple plan alas may not be meant for the liberals, free thinkers or the pure mavericks, who might at times find themselves constrained and caged by the plan and at large by society. And as a direct consequence, they seek creative and cognitive expression.
