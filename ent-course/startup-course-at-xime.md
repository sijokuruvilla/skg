# Startup course at XIME

I just completed offering my first ever course yesterday. I was invited as a guest faculty for the entrepreneurship course in this trimester. It was a good experience overall. Will look to capture the content & what all I attempted during the course through the blog series titled \#ENT101.

Also sharing the link to my [thinking deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ew179l1I_JVYcgM1jMsuejq9tuKr41b65JgG9_HB1HA/edit#slide=id.g2650a8be36_0_20), which contains a collection of thoughts I captured for purposes of covering in the course. Note: Not all topics in the topic have made it to the course decks

Each student has also been asked to come up with a blog post capturing one key learning from the course as part of their coursework itself. To see how the articles look like, you can [take a look at the one penned by Amarnath](https://medium.com/@amarnathkamaraj/productivity-tools-that-make-our-life-easy-77c9f000d685) \(It also happens to be his first ever blog post\). Once all have published their articles, will look to collate all into a publication as well on Medium.
