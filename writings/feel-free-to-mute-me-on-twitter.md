# Feel free to mute me on Twitter

Let me clarify how I approach Twitter — that should help understand the context of this post better. I make use of Twitter in the following three ways

1. As my public email
2. As my thoughts scribbler — micro blogging, taking notes etc
3. Getting the good work of people in our circle — through Retweets

In summary, I’m primarily looking to make use of a Twitter as a tool to converse with myself and people in my circles \(and not to the world out there\)

Given the context, I also do not intend to follow any handles. So if you wish to bring anything to my attention, you will need to tag me.

Also, wish to have each & everyone from our circle to collectively join in on \#3

It’s only recently I made a full switch to Twitter. Granted, I took me a look of time to get a sense of the platform and how make it work for me.

PS: I’ve gotten out of FB messaging completely & almost completely out of LinkedIn messaging as well. With Twitter approach working out well, I’ll also be exploring getting out of email.
