WEQ \(Women Entrepreneurship Quest\) is a flagship startup competition targeted at early stage founders hosted by Anita Borg Institute supported by DST & IUSSTF. The top 25 will be invited to GHCI conference and 10 winners will be taken on an all expense trip to Silicon Valley. I also happen to be a consultant to this year’s edition of WEQ. More details can be availed from their website — [bit.ly/WEQ2016](http://bit.ly/WEQ2016)

As part of the outreach efforts, there is a FB Live series that is being conducted and some fabulous women founders have been lined up. 3 Live sessions have been completed and 3 more are left — one happening today evening \(at 4pm\) and two tomorrow \(at 11am & 4pm\).

For today’s live it will be Shanti Mohan. She is the founder & CEO of LetsVenture, an online angel investing platform that has helped over 80 startups raise their angel funding \(1Cr to 4Cr range\) so far. Our very own iTraveller also managed to raise then 1Mn USD angel round thanks to the support they received from them.

One among the most powerful women founders in the Indian startup world now, Shanti has managed to rope in some of the best names in the angel investing world in the country to become investors into her company as well — the likes of Ratan Tata, Nandan Nilekani, Kunal Bahl, Sharad Sharma, Rajan Anandan etc. You can read more about Shanti [here](http://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/weve-brought-transparency-into-startup-funding-shanti-mohan-letsventure-17464/)

Tomorrow we have Sairee Chahal of Sheroes in the morning. Sairee is a bit of a phenomenon in the women space and being a tv personality also earlier, she has quite the following as well. Sheroes, a career destination for women, is working towards reducing the gender gap in the workforce. Sheores also recently raised Series A funding of 12 crores from Lumis partners.

One of the best ways to learn and broaden our perspective is through peer learning — from people who have been there and done that. And these women are some of the most accomplished in their respective domains. Those who nurture entrepreneurial ambitions or is looking to generally understand what is happening in the women startup space, these are the some of the best people that you could possibly connect with. Given that FB Live is also a QnA format, you also get to ask questions.

Given this context, should you feel that this could be beneficial for you in any way, I would highly recommend that you attend and take advantage of this FB Live talks that is happening today and tomorrow. Do also pass on the message to any friend or colleague of yours who could benefit.
