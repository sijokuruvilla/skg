# Joy of quiet

It has been sometime since I visited Vagamon. The last trip was immediately after my engineering along with my friends during our all Kerala bike trip. Realisation dawned en route our journey to the place that its been nearly 7 years since that.

I booked a tree top view room for a day at a resort named [Vagamon heights](http://www.vagamonheights.com/). The manager, Mr Siyad was a very friendly person. He even offered a small discount considering its a lean season and since there weren’t any other bookings for the weekend.

I had planned to leave somewhere around 7–8 in the morning from Cochin. But I had some work to attend to and eventually ended up starting our journey by around 11:30am. The roads were good throughout and the drive was nice. I took about 3 hours to reach there.The place is a 300 acre property. The place of stay was nice and comfortable and while not exactly being a tree top house, the view gave a good feeling of being perched upon a tree top.Tree top house view @ Vagamon heights

I pretty much ended up doing only relaxing and unwinding almost throughout the stay there. I ended up hanging around in the room till about 2pm until I finally decided to start my journey back.

The place was nice, calm and most importantly silent! It feels good to be cut off from everyday life and any form of digital connectivity for sometime. And its my second similar experience within a span of 3 months, the last one being Galibore fishing camp in December. I feel recharged and more importantly a lot more at peace with myself at the end of these trips. It gives me time and space to think, to calm the voices inside my head and to settle down my thoughts.

On that note, I would also like to refer to an article that I read recently — [The joy of quiet](http://www.todayonline.com/Commentary/EDC120103-0000009/The-joy-of-quiet). I would also go on to cite a few sentences from the article that captures the essence of what it is trying to convey.

1. The more ways we have to connect, the more many of us seem desperate to unplug.

2. The urgency of slowing down — to find the time and space to think — is nothing new, of course, and wiser souls have always reminded us that the more attention we pay to the moment, the less time and energy we have to place it in some larger context.

3. “All of man’s problems come from his inability to sit quietly in a room alone” ~ Blaise Pascal

4. “When things come at you very fast, naturally you lose touch with yourself.” ~Marshall McLuhan

5. We’re rushing to meet so many deadlines that we hardly register that what we need most are lifelines.

6. The central paradox of the machines that have made our lives so much brighter, quicker, longer and healthier is that they cannot teach us how to make the best use of them; the information revolution came without an instruction manual.

7. A series of tests in recent years has shown that after spending time in quiet rural settings, subjects “exhibit greater attentiveness, stronger memory and generally improved cognition. Their brains become both calmer and sharper”

8. Empathy, as well as deep thought, as neuroscientists have found, depends on neural processes that are “inherently slow”

Maybe I should now try a vow of silence for a day and see how it feels!
