# The Road Less Travelled

**Note**: This article was originally published on January 20, 2012

This happened sometime during my PGPM days. Idling away the leisure time I was awarded with thanks to the re scheduling of sessions, I came across a book during one of my random visits to the library. The title of the book itself caught my attention and stoked quite a few thoughts in me : The Road Less Travelled.

I then proceeded to check out what was the book all about. Interestingly it talked about one of those topics of life about which I have myself spent innumerable hours; thinking, experiencing, practicing and many a time avoiding.

“Confronting and solving problems is a painful process which most of us attempt to avoid. And the very avoidance results in greater pain and an inability to grow both mentally and spiritually. Facing our difficulties — and suffering through the changes — can enable us to reach a higher level of self — understanding.”

My mind instantly drifted to the words by a fairly renowned Sculpturist, during one of his talks during my high school days: “It is only by pain that birth \(creation\) happens, it is only by going through the pain of labour that lasting beauty is created.”

Didn’t take me much time henceforth to decide to get the book issued. And the person in-charge of issual, not surprisingly, gave me a look as if he is seeing an alien in his territory.

Getting back home I hit the bed with the book in my hand. And the very opening statements made the book a worthy read. And this is how it read. You guys may wanna take a look at it yourselves…

” Life is difficult… This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths. It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it. Once we truly know that life is difficult — once we truly understand and accept it — then life is no longer difficult. Because once it is accepted, the fact that life is difficult no longer matters”
