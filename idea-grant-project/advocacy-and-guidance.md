# Advocacy & Guidance

Idea Grant scheme by Kerala Startup Mission offers innovation grants upto 12L. In the 10th round of application of Idea Grant, they are inviting applications exclusively from students.

A good 2 to 3 hours is all that you need to put in a good application. And application submission deadline is only tonight. There still is time.

Startup Mission is also viewing this as a capacity building exercise and hence everyone are encouraged to apply — even the ones who feel they do not have an idea or that they idea is good enough.

You should also listen to Saji \(CEO, Kerala Startup Mission\) sharing the vision for Idea Grant scheme in his Live with Rethink. Absolutely informative and refreshing perspectives — a pleasing watch.
