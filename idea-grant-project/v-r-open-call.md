# v@r open call

These are the areas where we could use help with

1. We have created temp guidance Whatsapp groups for each college \([Context](https://blog.rethinkfoundation.in/idea-grant-guidance-temp-whatapps-groups-30939d9d8bc6)\). Need help to have applicants and aspirants from respective college added to these groups
2. We need help with providing guidance responses to queries that come in these groups. Most guidance aspects are covered by resources in this post — [Link](https://blog.rethinkfoundation.in/idea-grant-project-guidance-a6757f956e69). What will be required is for you to be familiar with these resources and the information in that for you to be able to provide guidance responses. One person can respond to queries in one of the groups or can look to be present in two — three college groups.
3. As and when people write in to v@r today for guidance on Idea Grant application, look to guide them to the corresponding temp whatsapp group of their college.
